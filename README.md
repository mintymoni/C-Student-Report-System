# Student Grade Calculator (C++)
This simple C++ program allows users to input a student's name, midterm grade, and final grade, and then computes the average.  
It also assigns a rank such as "With Honors" or "Failed" based on the computed average.

## Features
- Accepts user input (name, midterm, and final grades)
- Allows basic math operations (+, -, *, /)
- Calculates the average grade
- Displays the student's rank:
  - With Highest Honor (97–100)
  - With High Honor (94–96)
  - With Honor (90–93)
  - Passed (75–89)
  - Failed (below 75)

## How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the project in any C++ IDE (e.g., Code::Blocks, Dev-C++, Visual Studio Code).
3. Compile and run the `main.cpp` file.
4. Follow the prompts to enter student details and grades.

## Concepts Used
- Input and output (`cin`, `cout`)
- Variables and data types
- If–else conditional statements
- Arithmetic operations
- String handling

## Sample Output
enter student's name: Moni
enter midterms grade: 95
enter an operator (+, -, *, /): +
enter finals grade: 97

Student: Alex
Midterms: 95
Finals: 97
